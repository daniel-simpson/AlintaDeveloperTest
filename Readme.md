# Coding Test (BE)

Generally a candidate should be able to cover all key points in the interview and demonstrate a sound technical knowledge.

In the event that the candidate isn't able to do this but is very strong on cultural fit and behavioural responses AND there is evidence of adjacent technology experience, a coding test can be set to show that they can adapt to our tech stack.

## Key Points

For either back end or front end, they should build what is defined and then:

- Submit to either Github or Bitbucket
- Share the repository details
- Code should build and run
- Tests should pass
- Coding standard should be good
- Design needs to be clean, but not perfect
- Code performance, readability, maintainability

## Problem to Solve

Have the candidate build a simple API that allows:

- Adding customers
  - First name, last name and date of birth fields
- Editing customers
- Deleting customers
- Searching for a customer by partial name match (first or last name)

## Tech

- ASP.NET Core 2.2 API
- In memory entity framework store
- Dependency injection
- Basic XUnit tests
- Swagger / OpenAPI support
